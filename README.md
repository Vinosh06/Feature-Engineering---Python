DESCRIPTION

While searching for the dream house, the buyer looks at various factors, not just at the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.

Using the dataset, find the factors that influence price negotiations while buying a house.

There are 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
